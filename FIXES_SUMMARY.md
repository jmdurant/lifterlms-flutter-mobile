# Flutter LMS App - Course Navigation & Video Player Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. setState() called during build error
**Problem**: The app was calling `setState()` during the widget build phase when initializing video players.

**Solution**: 
- Used `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` to defer video player initialization until after the current build completes
- Added `mounted` checks before calling `setState()` in `_initializeVideoPlayer()`

### 2. Wrong course loading when navigating
**Problem**: When navigating between courses, sometimes the wrong course content would be displayed due to stale controller state.

**Solution**:
- Added `initializeFromArguments()` method to `LearningController` that properly checks for course ID changes
- Clear all previous state (lessons, videos, sections) when switching to a different course
- Added `onReady()` override in `CourseDetailController` to double-check arguments

### 3. YouTube/Vimeo videos not updating when lessons change
**Problem**: Video players were not properly updating when switching between lessons, causing the same video to play for different lessons.

**Solution**:
- Track current lesson ID with `_currentLessonId` variable
- Properly dispose of video controllers before creating new ones
- Use unique keys for video player widgets to force re-rendering
- Dispose controllers in proper lifecycle methods (`deactivate()`, `dispose()`)

### 4. Automatic lesson loading on course open
**Problem**: The first lesson was automatically loading when opening a course, triggering video initialization during build.

**Solution**:
- Removed automatic lesson loading in `loadCourseSectionsOnly()`
- Course overview is shown by default
- User must explicitly click "Start Learning" or select a lesson from the drawer

## Files Modified

1. **lib/app/controller/lifterlms/learning_controller.dart**
   - Added `initializeFromArguments()` method
   - Removed automatic first lesson loading
   - Improved state management and clearing

2. **lib/app/view/learning.dart**
   - Fixed video player lifecycle with `addPostFrameCallback()`
   - Added `mounted` checks before `setState()`
   - Improved video player disposal logic

3. **lib/app/controller/lifterlms/course_detail_controller.dart**
   - Added `onReady()` override to recheck arguments

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate between different courses**
   - Open Course A → Navigate to Course B
   - Verify Course B content loads correctly
   - No content from Course A should remain

2. **Switch between lessons with videos**
   - Open a lesson with YouTube video
   - Switch to another lesson with different video
   - Verify the correct video loads for each lesson

3. **Test the learning flow**
   - Open a course → See course overview
   - Click "Start Learning" → First lesson loads
   - Use navigation arrows to move between lessons
   - Videos should update correctly

## Key Improvements

✅ No more setState() during build errors
✅ Proper course content isolation
✅ Video players update correctly
✅ Better resource management
✅ User-controlled lesson loading (not automatic)
